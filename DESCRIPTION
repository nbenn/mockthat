Package: mockthat
Title: Function Mocking for Unit Testing in R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Nicolas",
           family = "Bennett",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "nicolas.bennett@stat.math.ethz.ch")
Description: With the deprecation of mocking capabilities shipped with
    'testthat' as of 'edition 3' it is left to third-party packages to replace
    this functionality, which in some test-scenarios is essential in order to
    run unit tests in limited environments (such as no Internet connection).
    Mocking in this setting means temporarily substituting a function with a
    stub that acts in some sense like the original function (for example by
    serving a HTTP response that has been cached as a file). The only exported
    function 'with_mock()' is modeled after the eponymous 'testthat' function
    with the intention of providing a drop-in replacement.
